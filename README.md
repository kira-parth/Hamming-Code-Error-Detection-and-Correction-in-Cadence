# Hamming-Code-Error-Detection-and-Correction-in-Cadence
• Designed and simulated a Hamming (7,4) encoder and decoder system using Cadence Virtuoso to detect and correct single-bit errors in digital data streams. • Implemented syndrome-based error correction using custom logic gates (XOR, AND) and a 3x8 decoder, validating functionality through waveform simulation and block-level integration.
